# 03-PlantEvo

This code is accompanying the GECCO 2003 paper on
[Demonstrating the Evolution of Complex Genetic Representations: An Evolution of Artificial Plants](https://argmin.lis.tu-berlin.de/papers/03-toussaint-GECCOb.p\df).

I resurrected the code, which was previously found at
myhomepage/source-code/plant.07.1.tgz, which I think is a stripped
down version of the original plantcode-03-04-11.tgz. This version
seems to only load a file of genetic codes and display them in an
OpenGL. The original code plantcode-03-04-11.tgz might include also
the evolution.

The present code includes the decoding of grammars to the plan
structure and display.

To compile
```
cd projects/plant
make
```
and run `./x.exe`
